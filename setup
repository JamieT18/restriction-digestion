Requirements for the script to work

Python 3 installed.
Valid input files:
DNA sequence file: Contains only A, C, G, T characters (other characters are ignored).
Restriction enzyme file: Each line is in the format:
EnzymeName,RecognitionSequence
or
EnzymeName<TAB>RecognitionSequence
(Lines can be comma- or tab-separated. Comments and malformed lines are skipped.)

What it does

Reads the DNA sequence from a file.
Reads restriction enzyme names and their recognition sequences from a file.
Finds all cut sites for each enzyme.
Reports:
Which enzyme cuts at which position.
Number of fragments.
Fragment lengths (in base pairs).

How to run

Assuming you have named the script restriction_digest.py, your DNA sequence is in dna.txt, and your enzyme list is in enzymes.txt:
python restriction_digest.py dna.txt enzymes.txt


Sample Input Files

dna.txt

This Python script performs an **in silico restriction digest** of a DNA sequence using a list of
specified restriction enzymes.By analyzing the input DNA and enzyme recognition sites, it simulates 
the cutting process and reports the resulting fragment sizes. This tool is useful for molecular 
biology experiments, cloning design, and educational purposes, enabling users to quickly predict 
fragment patterns without performing laboratory procedures.
